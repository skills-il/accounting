"""Split an Israeli timesheet into ordinary, overtime and rest-day hours, then tier the premiums.

Pure local arithmetic. No network, no third-party packages, no file writes.

OPTIONAL. Step 6 of SKILL.md states the same arithmetic inline for agents that cannot run scripts.

What it deliberately does NOT do:
  * It does not decide whether the Hours of Work and Rest Law applies to the worker at all. That is
    the Step 0 gate and it is a judgement about the real role, not arithmetic.
  * It does not know the regular hourly wage, because the statutory base includes every supplement
    the employer pays. You pass the rate in; the script never guesses one.
  * It does not compute tax, National Insurance, or net pay.
  * It does not decide whether a break was paid. You mark it; the law turns on whether the employee
    was required to stay, which no script can infer from timestamps.

Usage:
  python3 reconcile_hours.py --weekly-bound 42 --rate 60 \\
      --day "sun,08:00,17:00,0.75" --day "mon,08:00,19:30,0.75" \\
      --day "sat,09:00,15:00,0.5,rest"
  python3 reconcile_hours.py --example

SCOPE: ONE WEEK AT A TIME. The weekly limb is applied once, to whatever days you pass, so handing
it a month silently treats the month as a single week and mis-tiers everything. It refuses input
spanning more than 7 days for that reason; loop over weeks and sum the results yourself.
